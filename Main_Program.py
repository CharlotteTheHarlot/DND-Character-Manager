This is a Dungeon's and Dragon's character manager created by none other than Charlotte!
With this manager you will be able to:
Create, save, and load a character.
Keep track of stats like Con, Str, Wis, Int, Chr, and Dex.
Keep track of inventory.
Track useful things like current/max HP, Armor Class, Speed.
Have a built in dice roll function.
Have a built in currency function. (player wallet, purchases, sales, unit converter)
Track quests, allies, enimies, and guilds.
And as I think of more I will add it.
